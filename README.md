# Memory-Game

The Memory Game is a web-based game where players test their memory skills by matching pairs of cards. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a responsive design and utilizes the Google Fonts library for font styles.

The HTML structure defines the layout of the game, including containers for the game board, statistics, controls, and result display. The CSS styles provide visual elements such as card flipping animations, button styles, and overall styling for the game interface. The JavaScript code handles the game logic, including card generation, flipping, matching, moves counting, and a timer.

When the game starts, the player is presented with a grid of cards, each containing an image. The objective is to find and match all pairs of cards by flipping them over. The game keeps track of the number of moves the player makes and displays it in the statistics section. A timer also starts when the game begins, tracking the player's time to complete the game.

Once all pairs are successfully matched, a victory message is displayed, showing the player's total moves. The player can stop the game at any time using the "Stop Game" button, which reveals the control options again.

The project can be further extended and customized by modifying the item array to include different card images and adding more levels of difficulty. The code provides a solid foundation for creating an enjoyable and challenging memory game experience.
